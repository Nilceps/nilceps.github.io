                </h2>
                <p>This will serve as both a list of League rules and an explanation of how a standard SDPL season progresses. Feel free to contact the League Admins if you have any questions or if any rules need clarification.</p>

                  <span class="section-heading-lower">The Draft</span>
                </h2>
                <p>Each team will have 5 fixed players consisting of a Captain and 4 drafted players. The Captain is responsible for all official communication with the Admins and other Captains. Captains will be selected at the end of the signup period depending on the number of draft eligible players.</p>
                <p>Every captain is given a budget based on his MMR in comparison to other captains, each captain has to draft players for his team. In order to successfully draft a player he has to bid during the player auction. After the auction captains may chose to trade players in order to fill or upgrade certain positions.</p>
                <p>The player auction starts with the first player on the sign up list being up for drafting. Captains all bid for the player if there is no new bid after 5 seconds the player goes to the highest bidder. Then the next player on the sign up list is up for bidding.</p>
                <h2 class="section-heading mb-4">
                  <span class="section-heading-lower">Match Rules</span>
                </h2>
                <p>Matches are expected to start on time. If a team does not have enough players at start time, they should request a standin from the available pool or contact an admin.</p>
                <p>Team side and pick order are decided by coinflip. The winner of the coinflip has the choice of side or pick order in the first game, while the loser has the choice of side or pick order in the second game. In case of a third game the loser of the second game has the choice of side or pick order.</p>
                <p>Pause may be initiated at any time outside of an ongoing teamfight, and a succinct explanation of the reason provided in all-chat (regardless of all-chat allowance). BM pauses, tactical pauses, etc. are not permitted and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Resuming from a pause is permitted once both teams have acknowledged they are ready to continue.</p>
                <p>All-chat is permitted unless and until a Captain requests no all-chat. No all-chat requests may be made in the lobby, at the start of the match, or at any time during the match. If a non-Captain requests no all-chat, his or her Captain should be asked to confirm.</p>
                <p>Fake, tactical, or taunting ggs are not permitted. If a player calls gg by mistake it is up to him to clear up the misunderstanding as fast as possible.</p>
